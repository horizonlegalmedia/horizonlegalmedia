It’s important to read the entire contract carefully and seek legal advice if any part of the agreement is unclear or seems unfair. If a client refuses to sign a contract or seems reluctant to commit to clear terms, it could be a red flag. Freelancers and contractors should never start work without a signed agreement in place."

        conclusion: "Freelancers and contractors are independent workers who must take responsibility for protecting their rights and ensuring their interests are safeguarded. A well-written contract is the best way to avoid potential disputes, clarify expectations, and establish trust between both parties. By including essential elements like payment terms, intellectual property rights, and a clear scope of work, freelancers and contractors can create agreements that set them up for success, minimize risks, and allow them to focus on what they do best.",
